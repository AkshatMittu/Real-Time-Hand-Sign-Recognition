# Hand Sign Recognition
This application aims to facilitate the usage of Hand Signs (digits for now) in operating daily applications.

## Project:
This project was built using Machine Learning and Mediapipe packages in Python. The recognition of hand signs was done by plotting the landmarks using Mediapipe, these landmarks formed the data for the Machine Learning algorithms, to recognize the digits.
After training the algorithm to recognize the hand signs, each hand sign was given an action that had to be performed. This application was tested by playing a game called Brawlhalla (a fighting game) only using Hand Signs.

## Result:
The application worked well on the game, this application now can be used for other applications by just assigning the action to the Hand Sign

## Methodologies:
Algorithms such as Support Vector Machines, KNN and ANN were used to train on the data collected using Mediapipe
